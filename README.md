# IceSheetFDM
Short lecture on Finite-Difference Method for modeling ice sheet flow

This github repository includes the jupyter notebook about the ice sheet finite-difference method. Feel free to use the code and play around with it. For example, you can vary:
- time step and spatial resolution to investigate issues of numerical stability
- the value of the ice rheology parameter (bigA) to see how it affects the ice sheet profile
- the accumulation rate (bdot)
- etc.
