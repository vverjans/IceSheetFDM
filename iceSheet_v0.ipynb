    "\n",
    "We consider the problem of the flow of ice. This first part of the notebook gives the derivation of the finite-difference scheme for simulating glacier flow. The details of the derivation are explained during the lecture, and on the whiteboard. For those of you who are interested in the derivation of the momentum equations, I recommend:\n",

    "\n",
    "The essence of glacier flow physics lies in the notion of conservation of momentum: stresses acting on ice (gravity, friction with the bed, etc.) balance each other and cause ice deformation. The momentum conservation results in a complex system of equations: the \"Stokes equations\". But the system can be simplified to the \"Shallow Ice Approximation\" (SIA) if:\n",
    "1. We use the hydrostatic approximation in the vertical (vertical stress varies much more along the vertical than horizontal direction)\n",
    "2. We consider an ice mass along a flowline (2D) and neglect lateral forces\n",
    "3. The ice is frozen to its bed (i.e., all the ice flow is due to deformation under gravitational forces)\n",
    "\n",
    "The shear stress in the vertical reduces to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau_{xz}(z) = -\\rho g (h-z) \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $g$ is gravity (9.81 m s<sup>-2</sup>), $\\rho$ is the ice density ($\\sim$ 917 kg m<sup>-3</sup>), $h$ is the ice thickness, $x$ is the horizontal coordinate, $z$ is the vertical coordinate. This is literally the force that shears the ice!\n",
